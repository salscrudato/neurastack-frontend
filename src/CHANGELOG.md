**Date:** 2025-07-13
**Type:** Major Mobile Enhancement

### üöÄ Major Mobile Optimizations

#### Glass Morphism Enhancement
- **Enhanced backdrop filters**: Upgraded from `blur(20px)` to `blur(32-40px)` for premium glass effects
- **Safari compatibility**: Added `-webkit-backdrop-filter` support for iOS devices
- **Layered shadows**: Implemented multi-layer box shadows with inset highlights for depth
- **Optimized transparency**: Fine-tuned background opacity for better readability

#### Button Design Revolution
- **Touch targets**: Increased minimum button size to 56px (exceeds WCAG 44px requirement)
- **Enhanced hover states**: Improved visual feedback with subtle transforms and shadow effects
- **Glass morphism buttons**: Applied consistent glass effects across all interactive elements
- **Accessibility**: Added proper focus indicators and touch optimization

#### Mobile-First Responsive Design
- **Fluid border radius**: Implemented `clamp()` functions for responsive corner rounding
- **Adaptive sizing**: Dynamic button and input sizing based on screen size
- **Safe area support**: Added support for iOS safe areas (notch/home indicator)

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Hardware acceleration**: Added `will-change` and `backface-visibility` properties
- **Optimized animations**: Reduced animation duration on low-end devices
- **Efficient transitions**: Used `cubic-bezier` easing for smooth 60fps animations
